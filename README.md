Facebook Ads Performance Analytics Power BI ProjectWelcome to my latest Power BI analytics project and GitHub contribution! This dashboard provides a deep, data-driven look into Facebook Ads performance using real-world campaign data. My goal was to create a tool that not only displays metrics but also uncovers cost efficiency, demographic impact, and conversion trends, all powered by custom DAX measures and a strong focus on data storytelling.Table of ContentsIntroductionProject DescriptionInstallationUsageCustom DAX MeasuresScreenshotsLicenseIntroductionProject Title: Facebook Ads Performance AnalysisCreated By: Rakesh AamalepatilTools Used: Power BI, DAX, ExcelFocus Areas: Digital marketing metrics, audience segmentation, cost optimizationProject DescriptionThis Power BI dashboard offers a comprehensive analysis of Facebook ad campaigns across key performance indicators: CPA (Cost Per Acquisition), CPC (Cost Per Click), CPM (Cost Per Mille), CTR (Click-Through Rate), and conversion rates.

These measures calculate costs and efficiency ratios directly within Power BI, providing dynamic insights.MeasureFormulaDescriptionCPADIVIDE(SUM(data[spent]), SUM(data[total_conversion]))Cost Per Acquisition. This measure quantifies the average expense incurred to achieve a single customer action (conversion). It's a key indicator for overall campaign ROI.CPACDIVIDE(SUM(data[spent]), SUM(data[approved_conversion]))Cost Per Approved Conversion. This is a refined efficiency metric, focusing specifically on the cost to acquire a conversion that has been verified or approved, crucial for assessing true profitability.CPCDIVIDE(SUM(data[spent]),SUM(data[clicks]))Cost Per Click. This ratio determines the average amount spent for each time a user interacts with the ad by clicking on it. Itâ€™s vital for managing bidding strategies.CPMDIVIDE(SUM(data[spent]), SUM(data[impressions])) * 1000Cost Per Mille (Thousand Impressions). This industry-standard metric calculates the cost for the ad to be shown one thousand times, allowing for cost-comparison across different media channels.CRDIVIDE(SUM(data[total_conversion]),SUM(data[clicks]))Conversion Rate. This measures the effectiveness of the ad by calculating the percentage of clicks that successfully result in a desired conversion action.CTRDIVIDE(SUM(data[clicks]), SUM(data[impressions]))Click-Through Rate. This is the ratio of clicks to impressions, indicating how compelling and relevant the ad creative and targeting are to the audience who sees it.Explore the DAX Measures folder for detailed breakdowns and the business logic behind each formula.LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
